**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **IBM:**  
   - **Reason for Not Selection:** While IBM has a strong position in quantum computing, which is a future-forward technology, it faces stiff competition from other technology companies in the same space. The promise of large-scale applications in quantum technology is well noted, but it may take time before this can translate into consistent revenue that meets immediate investment needs. The uncertainties of quantum technology's practical applications compared to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI were key factors in not selecting IBM at this time.

2. **Robinhood:**  
   - **Reason for Not Selection:** Although Robinhood has shown impressive growth and a strong market presence in retail trading, the overall investment environment in financial technology can be quite volatile. The sustainability of its recent revenue spikes remains uncertain as the market matures. The company's future growth will heavily depend on its strategic decisions and responses to competitive pressures, making it a somewhat riskier investment compared to the more stable and expansive growth trajectory presented by Google in the AI sector.
